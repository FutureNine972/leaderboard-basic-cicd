My Intro to CI and CD for Deployment
======

### Introduction
This is one of the many repos used to display my progress on web dev.

This repo is moreso intended to guide me through deployment stuff rather than actually coding websites (because I already have those basic tools down).

Cd into `/basic_cicd` and do `./scripts/run.sh` to run the app.

Alternatively, you can do (within `/basic_cicd`):
* `source .venv/bin/activate`
* `flask --app __init__ run`

This is very easy to run but there isn't really a reason to. See my [frontend](https://github.com/FutureNine972/leaderboard-basic-vue) repo for my leaderboard project (which also requires the [backend](https://github.com/FutureNine972/leaderboard-basic-flask)) for a much better Flask experience.
